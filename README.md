#### This is a project to visualize a dataset of cataloguing metadata of a cookbook collection. The collection is held by the NYU Libraires Division. The raw dataset is available via https://wp.nyu.edu/administrativedepartment-nyu_libraries_cookbooks_collection/data-download/

#### The dataset is cleaned in [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org) before importing to Python.

#### The codes serve as part of the digital humanities project prototype design for the NYU course CEH-GA 1089-001:[Digital Humanities-Collections and Connections](http://kimon.hosting.nyu.edu/sites/dh-collections-connections/)
